# House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques

This project was developed for the Kaggle competition "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques," where the goal is to predict house sale prices using advanced regression techniques.

**Description**

In this competition, participants are required to predict house sale prices based on various property features. The task involves practicing feature engineering, Random Forests (RFs), and Gradient Boosting.

**Results**

My model achieved a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.25476, demonstrating strong predictive capability.

**Contents**

**Jupyter Notebook:** Used for exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model development.
**README.md:** This file.

**Dependencies**

To run this project, you will need to install the following libraries:

#### 1. Python 3.8+

#### 2. pandas

#### 3. numpy

#### 4. scikit-learn

#### 5. matplotlib

You can install the dependencies using the following command:
```pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib```

**Project Structure**

**1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Initial analysis to understand the distribution and correlations of variables.
  
**2. Feature Engineering:** Transformation and creation of new relevant features to improve model performance.
   
**3. Modeling:** Training and validation of various regression models, including Random Forests and Gradient Boosting.
   
**4. Evaluation:** Comparison of models using appropriate metrics and selection of the best-performing model.

**How to Run**

1. Clone this repository:
```git clone https://github.com/seu_usuario/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques.git```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```cd house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques```

3. Install the dependencies:
